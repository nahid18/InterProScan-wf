# InterProScan

[InterProScan](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/) provides functional analysis of proteins by classifying them into families and predicting domains and important sites [^1].

To classify proteins in this way, InterProScan uses predictive models, known as signatures, provided by several different databases (referred to as member databases) that make up the InterPro consortium. 

It combines protein signatures from these member databases into a single searchable resource, capitalising on their individual strengths to produce a powerful integrated database and diagnostic tool.
